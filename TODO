Things to be addressed, at some point. Unsorted, unprioritized, incomplete.

o x86 support
 - interrupt remapping support
  - IOAPIC virtualization [WIP]
  - MSI virtualization (for PCI and HPET)
  - VT-d setup
 - PCI resource access control
  - config space access moderation [WIP]
 - AMD64 (SVM) [WIP]
  - Do not vmexit on APIC reads (xAPIC mode)
 - power management
  - block
  - allow per cell (managing inter-core/inter-cell impacts)
 - moderate access to keyboard controller (ports 0x60/0x64)
o ARM support
 - v7 (32-bit)
 - v8 (64-bit)
o configuration
 - add official support to assign resources to multiple cells
   (shared pages, read-only PIO ports)?
 - review of format, rework of textual representation
 - platform device assignment
 - create base configuration from knowledge base and running system
   [WIP: python script, optional shell script for data collection on target]
o setup validation
 - check integrity of configurations
 - check integrity of runtime environment (hypervisor core & page_pool,
   probably just excluding volatile Linux-related state variables)
  - pure software solution (without security requirements)
  - Intel TXT support?
  - secure boot?
o inter-cell communication channel
 - shared memory + doorbell IRQs
 - queues + doorbell?
o testing
 - build tests for x86 and ARM
 - unit tests?
 - system tests, also in QEMU/KVM
  - VT-d emulation for QEMU [WIP: GSoC project]
o inmates
 - reusable runtime environment for cell inmates
  - skeleton in separate directory
  - hw access libraries (x86: APIC, TSC calibration, PCI, IOAPIC, ...)
  - inter-cell communication library
 - port free small-footprint RTOS to Jailhouse bare-metal environment
   [WIP: RTEMS]
o hardware error handling
 - MCEs
 - PCI AER
 - APEI
 - ...
o monitoring
 - report error-triggering devices behind IOMMUs via sysfs
 - hypervisor console via debugfs?
